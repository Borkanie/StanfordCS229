    "### Supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning you are given a set of inputs and outputs $(X,Y)$ and you are trying to learn a mapping from $X\\rightarrow Y$. \\\n",
    "The house selling market byu size is a \"Regression\" problem because the value that we are trying to predict is continous. \n",
    "There is another type of problem named a \"Classification\" problem because the Y is can only take a discrete number of values.\n",

    "> BASICALLY: IF THE POSSIBLE OUTPUT IS A DISCRETE ARRAY OF VALUES THE PROBLEM IS A CLASSIFICAITON PROBLEM, IF NOT IT IS A REGRESSION PROBLEM.\n",
